# WindowChanger
A tool which can automatically change the foreground window depending on times or intervals on Microsoft Windows Machines.

It has been developed for the graduation ball of the Higher Technical Collage Braunau (http://www.htl-braunau.at) in the year 2013 in let's say quite less time. 
Probably it was my first "project" in C#, so have fun reading this lines of code - even the comments are in german. :D

## What is it for?
In our case it's used to have some kind of slideshow on a monitor in every bar. Every 'x' minutes a promotion video has to appear
and stay for 'y' minutes. Beside this, there's a live stream of the opening part and some dances at midnight, where WindowChanger automatically
switches to this stream depending on a start- and endtime. If the bar's slideshow has some kind of sound running in a media player,
it gets turned off to hear the sound of the live-shows.

As I didn't want to do this on my own and run from bar to bar, I tried to automate this process.

## Feel free to use it
I personally don't have a usecase for this anymore, so if it's useful for you please take it or fork it. 
Altough I do have much more experience in developing now compared to my time in school, I don't have the time continuing this project.
BUT: I'd be happy to see, if someone continues or just updates this project. I think it could be a cool thing. ;-)
